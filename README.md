# prospect-finder

A Python-based tool designed to automate the discovery of local businesses without websites, enabling freelancers to identify potential clients for web development services. The script scrapes public data from sources like Google Maps or business directories (e.g., Pages Jaunes) to find businesses in a specified area, checks for the absence of a website, and exports the results to a CSV file for easy prospection.
Features

Automated Scraping: Extracts business details (name, address, website status) from public directories or search results.
Website Detection: Identifies businesses without a website for targeted outreach.
CSV Export: Saves prospects in a structured format for follow-up.
Customizable: Adaptable to different locations and business categories (e.g., restaurants, salons, shops).

Use Case
Ideal for freelance web developers looking to generate leads by offering website creation services to local businesses lacking an online presence.

Libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, selenium (optional for advanced scraping)
